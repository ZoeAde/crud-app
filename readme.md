#####Server-Side

1. Create the project structure

3. Create the RESTful route structure, based on the resource of your choice:
-GET ALL superheros
-GET single superhero
-POST ALL superheros
-PUT single superhero
-DELETE single superhero
4. Setup MongoDB, Mongoose, and define your schema
5. Update each route to connect to the database and return JSON
6. Use dotenv to manage environment variables


#####Client-Side

1. Render a single index.html file, which includes a form for adding (POST) a new superhero. Also, display ALL (GET) superheros below the form.
2. Handle client-side form validation with HTML5 attributes.s
3. Handle the form submission with jQuery. This must be a SPA (single page application)
